    question: 'Why is the sky blue?',
    emoji: '🌤️',
    description: 'The sky looks blue because sunlight bounces off tiny bits of air! Blue light scatters more than other colors, painting our sky blue.',
    detailedExplanation: 'When sunlight enters Earth\'s atmosphere, it collides with gas molecules. Sunlight is made up of all colors of the rainbow! Blue light has a shorter wavelength and gets scattered in all directions by the tiny molecules of air. This scattered blue light is what we see when we look up at the sky. During sunrise and sunset, the sky turns orange and red because sunlight has to travel through more atmosphere, scattering away the blue light!',

    question: 'Why do stars twinkle?',
    emoji: '⭐',
    description: "Stars don't actually twinkle! Their light wiggles through Earth's bumpy air, making them look like they're dancing.",
    detailedExplanation: 'Stars are actually steady balls of burning gas, just like our Sun! But when their light travels through Earth\'s atmosphere, it passes through layers of air that are moving and have different temperatures. This bends the light back and forth, making it look like stars are twinkling. In space, astronauts see stars as steady points of light because there\'s no atmosphere to make them twinkle!',

    question: 'Why do we yawn?',
    emoji: '🥱',
    description: 'Yawning helps wake up your brain! It brings in fresh air and stretches your face muscles when you\'re tired or bored.',
    detailedExplanation: 'Scientists believe yawning helps cool down your brain and wake it up! When you yawn, you take a big breath of cool air and stretch your jaw muscles. This increases blood flow to your brain and makes you more alert. Yawning is also contagious - when you see someone yawn, your brain copies them! This might have helped our ancestors stay alert together as a group.',

    question: 'How do birds fly?',
    emoji: '🐦',
    description: 'Birds have special hollow bones and strong wings! They push air down to go up, just like you push water in a pool to float.',
    detailedExplanation: 'Birds are amazing flying machines! Their bones are hollow and filled with air pockets, making them super lightweight. Their wings are curved on top and flatter on the bottom, which creates lift when air flows over them. Strong chest muscles power their wing flaps. Feathers are perfectly designed - some for flying, some for steering, and some for staying warm. Different birds have different wing shapes for how they fly!',

    question: 'Why is water wet?',
    emoji: '💧',
    description: 'Water loves to stick to things! Its tiny drops hold hands with each other and with anything they touch, making things feel wet.',
    detailedExplanation: 'Water molecules are like tiny magnets that love to stick together and to other things! Each water molecule has a positive end and a negative end, so they attract each other. When water touches your skin, the molecules stick to you and spread out in a thin layer. Your nerves feel this layer and send a "wet" signal to your brain. Wetness is really just how we feel water molecules clinging to us!',

    question: 'Why do we need sleep?',
    emoji: '😴',
    description: 'Sleep is like charging your phone! Your body fixes itself, your brain saves memories, and you grow taller while sleeping.',
    detailedExplanation: 'Sleep is when your body does its most important repair work! Your brain sorts through everything you learned and saves important memories. Growth hormones are released, helping kids grow taller and stronger. Your immune system gets stronger to fight germs. Your muscles repair themselves from the day\'s activities. Without enough sleep, it\'s harder to focus, learn, and even control your emotions!',

    question: 'How do plants eat food?',
    emoji: '🌱',
    description: 'Plants make their own food using sunlight! They catch light with their leaves and mix it with water and air. Pretty cool chefs!',
    detailedExplanation: 'Plants are incredible food factories! Through photosynthesis, they use sunlight as energy to combine water (from their roots) and carbon dioxide (from the air) to make sugar - their food! The green color in leaves comes from chlorophyll, which captures sunlight. As a bonus, plants release oxygen into the air - the very oxygen we breathe! One big tree can make enough oxygen for two people for a whole year!',

    question: 'Why do cats purr?',
    emoji: '🐱',
    description: 'Cats purr when they\'re happy, but also to heal themselves! The vibration is like a massage for their body.',
    detailedExplanation: 'Cats make that rumbling purr sound using special muscles in their throat! They purr when happy and relaxed, but also when scared or hurt. Scientists discovered that purring vibrations (between 25-150 Hz) can actually help heal bones and reduce pain! It\'s like a built-in healing system. Kittens start purring when they\'re just a few days old to communicate with their mom. Each cat has its own unique purr!',

    question: 'Why do we have fingerprints?',
    emoji: '👆',
    description: 'Fingerprints help you grip things better! They\'re like tiny patterns that make your fingers less slippery. No two are the same!',
    detailedExplanation: 'Your fingerprints are formed before you\'re even born and stay the same your whole life! The ridges and swirls help you grip things by creating friction, like the treads on a tire. They also make your fingertips super sensitive to touch. Every person has completely unique fingerprints - even identical twins have different ones! That\'s why police use fingerprints to identify people. You have about 100 ridges per fingerprint!',

    question: 'Why does ice float on water?',
    emoji: '🧊',
    description: 'Ice is like a fluffy blanket! When water freezes, it spreads out and becomes lighter than liquid water, so it floats on top.',
    detailedExplanation: 'This is actually super unusual - most things get denser (heavier for their size) when they freeze! But water is special. When it freezes, the molecules arrange themselves in a crystal pattern that takes up MORE space, making ice less dense than liquid water. This is why ice floats! This is really important for life on Earth - if ice sank, lakes would freeze from the bottom up and fish couldn\'t survive winter!',

    question: 'How does the internet work?',
    emoji: '🌐',
    description: 'The internet is like a huge web of computers talking to each other! Data travels through cables and satellites at super speed.',
    detailedExplanation: 'The internet is a massive network connecting billions of devices worldwide! When you visit a website, your request travels as tiny packets of data through cables (even under oceans!), routers, and sometimes satellites. These packets can take different paths and reassemble at their destination. Data centers store websites on powerful servers. Your data can travel around the world in milliseconds - faster than you can blink! The internet uses protocols like TCP/IP to make sure everything arrives correctly.',

    question: 'Why can airplanes fly?',
    emoji: '✈️',
    description: 'Airplane wings are shaped to push air down, which pushes the plane up! It\'s called lift, and engines give the speed needed.',
    detailedExplanation: 'Airplanes fly using four forces: lift, weight, thrust, and drag. Wings are curved on top and flatter below - when air flows over them, it moves faster over the top, creating lower pressure above the wing. This pressure difference creates lift! Engines provide thrust to move forward fast enough for lift to work. Pilots control flaps and ailerons on the wings to steer. A Boeing 747 can weigh up to 400 tons but still soar through the sky!',

    emoji: '🧠',
    description: 'Your brain has 86 billion neurons firing electrical signals! They control everything from thoughts to heartbeats.',
    detailedExplanation: 'Your brain is the most complex object in the known universe! It contains about 86 billion neurons, each connected to thousands of others - that\'s more connections than stars in the Milky Way! Neurons communicate using electrical signals and chemical messengers called neurotransmitters. Different brain regions handle different jobs: the frontal lobe for thinking, the occipital lobe for seeing, the hippocampus for memory. Your brain uses about 20% of your body\'s energy!',

    question: 'Why do we dream?',
    emoji: '💭',
    description: 'Dreams help your brain sort memories and process emotions! They happen during REM sleep when your brain is super active.',
    detailedExplanation: 'Dreams mostly happen during REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, when your brain is almost as active as when you\'re awake! Scientists believe dreams help process emotions, consolidate memories, and solve problems. Your brain paralyzes your muscles during REM sleep so you don\'t act out your dreams. We dream about 4-6 times per night but forget most dreams. Lucid dreamers can actually control their dreams! Dreams might also help us practice handling challenging situations.',

    question: 'How do magnets work?',
    emoji: '🧲',
    description: 'Magnets have invisible force fields! Tiny particles inside them line up to create push and pull powers.',
    detailedExplanation: 'Magnetism comes from electrons - tiny particles that orbit atoms and spin like tops. In most materials, electrons spin in random directions and cancel out. But in magnets, many electrons spin the same way, creating a magnetic field! This field has a north and south pole. Opposite poles attract; same poles repel. Earth itself is a giant magnet, which is why compasses work! Electromagnets use electricity to create temporary magnetic fields - they\'re used in everything from speakers to MRI machines.',

    question: 'Why is time different in space?',
    emoji: '⏰',
    description: 'Time actually slows down when you go super fast! Astronauts age slightly slower than people on Earth. Mind-blowing!',
    detailedExplanation: 'Einstein\'s theory of relativity revealed that time isn\'t constant - it changes based on speed and gravity! When you travel close to the speed of light, time slows down for you compared to someone standing still. This is called time dilation. Gravity also affects time - clocks run slightly slower near massive objects. GPS satellites have to account for this or they\'d be inaccurate! Astronaut Scott Kelly aged about 5 milliseconds less than his twin brother after a year in space.',

    question: 'How does AI think?',
    emoji: '🤖',
    description: 'AI learns from millions of examples! It finds patterns in data, like learning to recognize cats from thousands of cat photos.',
    detailedExplanation: 'Artificial Intelligence doesn\'t actually "think" like humans - it processes patterns! Machine learning algorithms analyze huge amounts of data to find patterns. Neural networks, inspired by human brains, have layers of connected nodes that process information. AI learns by adjusting these connections based on feedback. ChatGPT was trained on billions of words from the internet! AI can now write, create art, play games, and even drive cars. But it doesn\'t understand meaning - it predicts likely outputs based on patterns.',

    emoji: '❤️',
    description: 'Emotions are your brain\'s way of helping you survive! Fear keeps you safe, happiness makes you connect with others.',
    detailedExplanation: 'Emotions evolved to help us survive and thrive! Fear triggers fight-or-flight responses to keep you safe from danger. Happiness and love encourage social bonding, which helped our ancestors survive in groups. Disgust protects you from eating harmful things. Emotions involve your whole body - your brain releases chemicals like dopamine (pleasure) and adrenaline (excitement), your heart rate changes, and muscles tense or relax. The amygdala in your brain is especially important for processing emotions!',

    question: 'How do submarines go underwater?',
    emoji: '🚢',
    description: 'Submarines use special tanks that fill with water to sink and air to float! It\'s like a fish controlling its swim bladder.',
    detailedExplanation: 'Submarines control their depth using ballast tanks! To dive, valves open and seawater floods into the tanks, making the sub heavier than the water around it, so it sinks. To rise, compressed air blows the water out, making the sub lighter, so it floats up. Smaller trim tanks fine-tune the angle. Submarines can stay underwater for months using nuclear power! They "see" underwater using sonar - sending out sound waves that bounce off objects. Modern subs can dive deeper than 300 meters!',

    description: 'Earth\'s insides are super hot! When melted rock (magma) builds up pressure, it bursts through weak spots in the crust.',
    detailedExplanation: 'Earth\'s core is incredibly hot - about 6,000°C, as hot as the Sun\'s surface! This heat melts rock into magma, which is less dense than solid rock, so it rises. When magma collects in chambers near the surface and pressure builds up (from gases and more magma), it eventually explodes through volcanic vents! The Pacific Ring of Fire has 75% of world\'s volcanoes because that\'s where tectonic plates meet. Some volcanoes ooze lava slowly; others explode violently. Yellowstone sits on a supervolcano!',
