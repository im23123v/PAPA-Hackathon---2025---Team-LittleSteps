# 🎯 LittleSteps – Building Mindful Digital Habits

> **PAPA Community Hackathon | 24-Hour Solo Hackathon Project**

---

## 🧠 Overview

**Attention Wallet** is built on a simple but powerful idea:  
👉 *What if attention was treated like money?*

In today’s world, attention is constantly spent—often unconsciously—on distracting digital experiences. This project reimagines attention as a **valuable asset** that users can **earn, spend, and invest wisely**.

The goal is to help users—especially children—develop **healthier digital habits**, conscious screen usage, and meaningful learning experiences.
